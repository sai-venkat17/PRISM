PageRank (PR) is an algorithm developed by Google Search to rank web
pages in their search engine results. It is named after both the term "web page" and
co-founder Larry Page. It is a link-analysis algorithm which assigns numerical
weighting to each element of the web graph. This weight measures the “relative”
importance of the web page within the graph. PageRank works by counting the
number of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website
is. It was first used to rank web pages in the Google search engine. Nowadays, it is
more and more used in many different fields, for example in social network graphs
of users in social media, ranking authors based on research paper citations etc. The
assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other
websites.

In this project we improved this Page rank by reducing the time consumption and enforcing personalization to it.
